# DenVis v1.0

DenVis is the visual analytic toolkit for syndromic surveillance of Dengue Disease especially for Lahore, Pakistan. It evaluates statistical and spatio-temporal dynamics of Dengue. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide every year, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue fever can also lead to severe complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, which can be fatal. The software aims to provide a visual and interactive way of exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of Dengue fever outbreaks, i.e., hotspots of disease in different regions and time periods using heatmap. The software also allows users to apply mathematical models and statistical methods to simulate and detect anomalies in time series.

## Features

1. Statistical Analysis and Anomaly Identification
2. Spatio-temporal Visualization by generating hotspots
3. Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling i.e., Time Series Forecasting upto 3 days
4. Data Aggregation using clustering algorithm
5. Syndromic Surveillance
6. User-friendly Interface and Interactivity

## How to use it?

1. You can download and view Demonstration.mp4 and Flow Diagram.
2. Dataset to be used or imported in the toolkit must have the same pattern and attributes as the data to be made available on request e.g. Date format, Coordinates must already be added in the Dataset otherwise analysis won't work.
3. Dataset must be preprocessed before using it i.e., null values, excluding irrelevant attributes etc.
4. Shapefiles for Lahore, Pakistan will be associated and compiled automatically while installation, still they have been added in _src/Shapefile/Lahore towns uc and vill_.
