# Healthcare-Toolkit-v1.0

Healthcare-Toolkit is the visual analytic toolkit for syndromic surveillance of Dengue Disease especially for Lahore, Pakistan. It evaluates statistical and spatio-temporal dynamics of Dengue. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide every year, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue fever can also lead to severe complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, which can be fatal. The software aims to provide a visual and interactive way of exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of Dengue fever outbreaks, i.e., hotspots of disease in different regions and time periods using heatmap. The software also allows users to apply mathematical models and statistical methods to simulate and detect anomalies in time series.
